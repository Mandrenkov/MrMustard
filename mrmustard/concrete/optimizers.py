class Optimizer:
    r"""An optimizer for any parametrized object.
    It can optimize euclidean, orthogonal and symplectic parameters.

    NOTE: In the future it will also include a compiler, so that it will be possible to
    simplify the circuit/detector/gate/etc before the optimization and also
    compile other types of structures like error correcting codes and encoders/decoders.
