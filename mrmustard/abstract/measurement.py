# TODO: the recompute_project_onto trick is there because measurements are treated differently from gates: the parameters
# are assumed to be mostly constant and they can be called with additional kwargs if we want the internal representation to be recomputed.
# However, we should find the how to make them work the same way, i.e. use xxx_trainable and xxx_bounds for all of the measurement parameters.
# This is a problem due to the generality of Generaldyne: for homodyne and heterodyne we could already do it, as they
# depend on euclidean parameters, rather than on a Gaussian state.
